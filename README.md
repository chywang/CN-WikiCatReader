Learning Fine-grained Relations from Chinese User Generated Categories. EMNLP 2017: 2577-2587

This is an updated version, we make slight changes and add more heuristics to extract more relations.
For is-a relations, we extract 1.94M relations instances, instead of 1.12M, as reported in the paper. For non-taxonomic rlations, we extract 0.49M relation instances. Other resources can be found at https://chywang.github.io.
